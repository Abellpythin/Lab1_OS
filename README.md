# Programming Lab 1 - C Programming

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, a student should be able to:

1. Gain experience in C programming
2. Use system calls to accomplish tasks
3. Use memory allocation
4. Implement a makefile to compile and link your program

## Introduction

This lab will require you to implement two C functions, `readString()`,  `mysteryExplode()`, and a Makefile. the `readString()` function reads a single line from a file and returns the string in dynamically allocated memory as a char pointer.  The `mysteryExplode()` function explodes the c-string as described below.  You will also need to include a makefile to compile and link your program into an executable called _explode_.

## Files

This lab is templated at

```
https://github.com/mrasamny/csci-320-lab1
```

Click the <span style="background-color: green;color:white;">Use this template</span> button to make  a copy of the repo to your GitHub account and **clone** _your_ repo on **your VM**.  You should commit your code as you work on your program and push it systematically to your repo.  **Your finalized product should be on your GitHub repo**.


Included in the repo are,

- **lab1.h** - definitions relevant to this programming project. DO NOT MODIFY.
- **lab1.c** - this is where you implement the required functions.  This file will be submitted on CodeGrade.
- **main.c** - contains main function.  DO NOT MODIFY.
- **README.md** - this file.

## Mystery Explosion

A word explosion mystery has occurred. However, to figure out the mystery and how a word explodes into a reoccurring new one, you will only be provided an example with no context clues.

A non-empty string such as `"Code"` is turned into `"CCoCodCode"`.

Return a new string similar to the string given above. For example,

```
mysteryExplode("Code") --> "CCoCodCode"
mysteryExplode("abc") --> "aababc"
mysteryExplode("ab") --> "aab"
mysteryExplode(":-)") --> "::-:-)"
```

## Requirements

You are required to complete the following:

1. Implement the two functions in the **lab1.c** file as declared and commented in the **lab1.h** file.
2. Write a **makefile** that will compile and link your program into an executable called _explode_.

## Program Specifications

Your program must perform the following:

1. Dynamically allocates memory in which to store 99 characters plus a null character for a total of 100 characters.
2. Reads a line from a text file and stores it in the dynamically allocated memory.  
3. Dynamically allocates <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">the exact amount of memory</span> to fit the exploded string.
4. Use the `malloc` function to allocate dynamic memory.


## Submission

Your are to submit the **lab1.c** and **makefile** on CodeGrade.  The link to the submission portal is in the Programming Activities page on your class Blackboad.
